*Scout* is an open-source custom quadcopter flight controller firmware that I developed from absolute scratch. The *Scout Flight Controller* is written in MicroPython and runs on a $4 Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Development Tutorial
I'm publicly sharing all that I learned during the three months I spent dreaming about and developing *Scout*. I wrote a 12-chapter series on how I developed *Scout* and the hardware requirements. You can find the articles on Medium below:
